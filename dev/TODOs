WIP - # TODO: dynamically create subdirs for YYYY and NUM-MONTH for each directory in DTN Reports
# TODO: Update with Windows filepaths (staging and prod)
# TODO: if set date has no draft notices (aka draft notice bar not found) then just skip draft notices and continue to 3rd Flow)
# TODO: Current UI glitch prevents filter heads from appearing properly on DOM. Only solution is to restart script entirely; timeout logic to automatically restart script if filter head not found after retries

FYI: running dtn-botâ€™s main.py must be done like so:
/Users/ekim/opt/anaconda3/envs/bots/bin/python -m src.test.main
if using pycharm, ensure that the configuration is set to module name: src.test.main and working directory set to ~dtn-bot/src
this is b/c python does not recognize the current working directory src as a package despite pages and test modules being nested within src !!!

# TODO: Running scripts/delete_pdf_files.sh - pathing issue when ran in terminal vs pycharm due to similar issue above ^^^
#TODO: Doesn't rename or delete original CCM after finishing 3rd Flow. Timing issue???



# Chores
# TODO: docstrings for all funcs
# TODO: README for running main.py. SEE BELOW


# Improvements
# TODO: directory paths simplier/cleaner? might require more work/tinkering....
