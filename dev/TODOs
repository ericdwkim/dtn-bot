FYI: running dtn-botâ€™s main.py must be done like so:
/Users/ekim/opt/anaconda3/envs/bots/bin/python -m src.test.main
if using pycharm, ensure that the configuration is set to module name: src.test.main and working directory set to ~dtn-bot/src
this is b/c python does not recognize the current working directory src as a package despite pages and test modules being nested within src !!!
